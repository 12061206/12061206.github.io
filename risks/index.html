                <h2>Risks in more depth</h2>
                <p>
                    Although self-driving cars have many benefits, they do come with risks. Innovation right now is costly, but not inevitable. A huge risk is the autonomous vehicle causing accidents. Currently, it is very hard to train self-driving cars for rare scenarios such as animals, severe weather, pedestrians and accidents. Sensors and cameras right now are not ready to operate under severe weather such as hail, snow, or sand. A computer malfunction could cause far worse accidents than a human typically would. This begins the debate of who’s at fault. Is it the company who sells the vehicle, the company that manufactures parts for the vehicle or will it be blamed on the software developers? Driverless cars trigger many debates around legal, ethical and financial responsibility. Another question is who is responsible if the car is involved with a crime. This presents another problem which is privacy. Driverless cars rely on the collection of data which include location and user information. Many people may not be comfortable with that information floating around in the cloud which people can access. Hackers are also a problem as they could get into the software in order to control the car which is a major concern.

                    Unemployment is another risk. People whose job is to drive trucks, taxis or buses would find themselves out of a job. According to the U’S Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2019, over 2 million people were employed as tractor-trailer truck drivers, over 370,000 people employed as taxi or delivery drivers and over 680,000 people employed as bus drivers. The total potential job losses come to over 2.9 million people which is more than the number of jobs lost during the 2008 Great Recession. When you include delivery and light truck drivers, the total number of potential job losses come to 4.5 million. When taking into account supervision, management and support staff for these jobs, the number of driving jobs lost could over double. Another disadvantage of self-driving vehicles is that very few people will know how to drive a car anymore and it would become a hobby to drive your car at a track.

                    Other consequences to self-driving cars is the effect on the automotive industry. Why own an expensive machine that is likely to break down at some point when instead you can with a tap of a button summon a driverless car that you don’t have to maintain. With less people owning cars and using rideshare services, the number of jobs such as mechanics and salespeople will decrease. This will destroy the automotive industry and billions of dollars of economic output. Car insurance will also become a thing of the past with this technology. Insurance companies depend on the risk of an accident but this technology will eliminate drier error.
