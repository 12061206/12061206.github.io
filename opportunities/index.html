                    Self-driving cars present many opportunities. In the United States, driver error is responsible for about 80% of all auto accidents. The introduction of driverless cars would reduce or eliminate these collisions. Driving while inebriated or under the influence of drugs will likewise be a thing of the past. In metropolitan locations, traffic should be better organised to avoid bottlenecks and traffic jams during peak hours. Speed limits could also be safely increased because self-driving cars would be able to communicate with each other. Commute times could be dramatically reduced. This greater efficiency would mean less pollution and fewer emissions from cars. Cars could travel at higher speeds and they could tailgate each other further increasing efficiency and because they are in sync with each other, errors would be eliminated.

                    Passengers could also sleep over the duration of the journey as they wouldnâ€™t require a driver. Cars may become little leisure rooms without the need for a driver. There would be more space inside the car if there were no need for controls, and passengers would not have to face forwards. In effect, they may provide pleasant travel conditions. People who are unable to drive such as elderly, disabled and children would be able to freely travel solo in a car as they are not required to control it. Cars would be self-aware, leading to fewer car thefts. Because rideshare services such as Uber would have large fleets, fewer people would own cars as it would be more cost efficient to pay per ride. Parking would become fully autonomous as it could drop you off where you need to be and park itself or drive around the block while it waits.

                    The urban centres would evolve as cities would be designed less around cars to few, narrower roads allowing for more building space. Driverless cars can be used to drive to your office and drive clients around to have meetings. People would be more inclined to live further away from the main city and in rural areas because these self-driving cars would commute to and from work in shorter times because of significantly increased efficiency while the passenger also being able to relax.
