                <h2>Michael Ethical</h2>
                <p>
                    The ethical ramifications of self-driving vehicles, for me, are mainly composed of the issues regarding accidents, and personal responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar to the famous ‘trolley’ dilemma, where a person is forced to make a choice between killing one person, or many, programmers must face an ethical dilemma when programming self-driving cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, if a crash is unavoidable, whose safety should the onboard computer prioritise? Should a car always prioritise it’s passengers, or should it prioritise those who are most likely to be injured, such as pedestrians?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we are to approach this dilemma from a strictly objective viewpoint, obviously the answer would be that which saves the greatest amount of human life possible. However, just as in the trolley dilemma, when it comes to reality, the answer isn’t so simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, not many people would be willing to buy, or even ride a car if it knew that it would potentially make an active decision to kill it’s passenger, even if that was for the greater overall good. Additionally, when taking into account the various safety features of modern day vehicles, the situation becomes murky much more quickly. Should a self-driving car deliberately crash into an uninvolved vehicle to avoid a more deadly crash, potentially injuring innocent bystanders in an attempt to prevent a greater loss of life?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The people responsible for these decisions, namely, the programmers and corporations responsible for making these self-driving vehicles, can be considered to have a measure of responsibility for the loss of life caused by this programming. But can this also apply in a legal sense? If the laws around the programming of Autonomous Vehicles remain as vague as they currently are, we could see lawsuits being brought against the manufacturers of such vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My personal recommendation when it comes to this issue, is that a global standard around the programming of autonomous vehicles needs to be drawn up and codified in law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ethical ramifications and decisions regarding the decision making of self-driving vehicles when it comes to vehicular accidents needs to be debated in government, as to avoid these decisions being left solely to corporations. Especially so since the corporations making these vehicles are incentivised by profit, and this would naturally factor into their decision making.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such a standard would also ideally be implemented globally, as to prevent cars being locked into specific countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, these are merely my personal recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My overall personal reflections on this topic, is that despite the ethical issues involved, self-driving vehicles are a great opportunity for the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When people think about big, life changing technology advancements, the type that exist in a world of tomorrow, self-driving vehicles are one of the things that exist there, alongside jetpacks, teleportation, and space travel. But of those technologies, the only one that has the potential to be fully realised and accessible to me, in my lifetime, seems to be self-driving cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though the rise of self-driving vehicles might be upsetting to motor enthusiasts, I have never particularly had a major interest in driving, and the ability to turn a commute time into leisure time is very exciting to me. Not to mention the potential environmental gains, and increase of safety, caused by the realisation of this technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be difficult for society to initially accept Autonomous Vehicles, but in the end, I believe the overall benefits will outweigh the downsides of this technology.
