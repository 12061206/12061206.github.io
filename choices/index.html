                <h2>Choices in more depth</h2>
                <p>
                    What choices are available when adopting Autonomous Vehicles?
                    <br>
                    There are a few different main areas of Automation that have different options available to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The first is how far will we go with automation?
                    <br>
                    Right now, the Society for Automotive Engineers has broken down the degree of how autonomous a vehicle is, to 6 different levels, from fully driver controlled, to fully automated driving.

                    </figure>
                    As technology grows, we will slowly progress towards level 6, though it is unsure just where precisely we will end up.
                    <br>
                    Currently, we already have multiple levels in use, with Tesla’s cars already able to drive at level three, but we still see the vast majority of vehicles at level one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second major area of choice is in the technology used.
                    <figure class="figure">
                        <img src="https://www.aurecongroup.com/-/media/images/aurecon/content/markets/transport/future-transport/section-2/aurecon-survey-results-transport-demand.png?la=en">

                    The most vital part of technology involved in self-driving cars are the sensors which allow the car to see its surroundings.
                    <br>
                    Currently, different developers use different sensors in combination with each other - 
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cameras</li>
                        <li>Radar</li>
                        <li>LiDAR</li>
                        <li>Ultrasonic wheel sensors</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, there are choices to be made about how to present this data to the driver, as well as how to present the data to other vehicles.
                    Possible interfaces include a heads-up display, or different screens.
                    <br>
                    When communicating with other cars, a variety of different methods can be used, from cellular data to radio signals.
                    <br>
                    But finally, the most important area of things that society will need to make a choice about is how to legislate Autonomous Vehicles
                    <br>
                    The technology used for autonomous vehicles is heavily reliant upon machine learning algorithms, however, there currently isn’t a single standard across the industry on how machine learning is trained, tested, or validated.
                    <br>
                    In fact, there isn’t a single standard across the industry for anything concerning autonomous vehicles.
                    <br>
                    As we move forward with this technology, governments will have to decide how to legislate vehicles going forward, setting a unified standard for such things as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Machine learning</li>
                        <li>Sensors required</li>
                        <li>Specific functions such as automated lane keeping systems</li>
                        <li>Operational learning</li>
                        <li>Right of way and priority of life when faced with unavoidable crashes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Currently there is a voluntary international standard for some of these, however there are no specific regulations regarding these important functions.
                    <br>
                    Though governments currently have limited legislation in place just to allow testing, as the technology progresses, regulations will have to progress with it.
