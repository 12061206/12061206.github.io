                <h2>Lachlan Ethical</h2>
                <p>
                    There are three ethical issues with self-driving cars currently, privacy, unemployment and  accepting artificial intelligence. With all the sensors required to have a vehicle be fully autonomous without the input or supervision of a human, we lose a lot of privacy because all the data gets collected and then large companies then have the power to do whatever they want to do with it. Another ethical issue is unemployment. When fully autonomous self-driving cars do become a thing, all jobs that require driving such as truck drivers, delivery drivers and taxi/rideshare drivers will all lose their jobs as they will have been replaced by more cost efficient solutions. People who sell and service current vehicles are also likely to lose their jobs as fewer people are going to own self-driving cars as it will be more cost effective to pay for a rideshare service which are going to mass buy these vehicles. As humans, we are usually able to make a decision in a split second whether it is right or wrong is different. The AI used to control these self-driving vehicles need to have the same ability to make a split decision decision that then makes the best decision. An example of this is if a car in front crashes. Does it rear end the car creating a multi-car pile up, swerve off the road then risking the driver and the occupants or risk going in the opposite direction to avoid the car? AI has to make the correct split second decision which it is currently not able to do. Many people aren’t comfortable with AI controlling the car which is understandable as you don’t want to risk your life by getting into a vehicle controlled by something that is not properly trained and prepared for all situations.

                    Personally I think that self-driving cars are the future whether we like it or not. It is generally more efficient and safer for most people. Although it is a controversial development, it is going to be both beneficial and harmful. The idea of automatic transmission cars I think has been the same because people newer to driving have no clue how to drive manually, which also makes a decent mechanism to stop cars from being stolen. People who use self-driving cars will lose the practical skills of knowing how to drive which I think is important. Driving will likely become a hobby which you can only do at a track because of many rules and regulations likely to be put in place by governments. Although many companies say they don’t share that data that is collected, almost everyone knows that it is shared for the reason of money, which is what these large companies want to get. Although a lot of the data is to help with all the other self-driving vehicles, ethically it isn’t right to share this data which is likely to happen. Governments will be able to track everyone, not that they don’t already do that but they will then have the power to manipulate the population.

                    Companies creating these self-driving vehicles need to consider these ethical issues and so do the consumers to ensure everyone is safe and know what information is being shared so that if people aren’t comfortable, there may be other options. Self-driving cars are definitely going to be the future and people need to adapt which will take time so governments and manufacturing companies will need to slowly implement self-driving cars and laws around them.
