                    The ethical consequences of having self-driving vehicles, to me, is that machines are not able to make the same decisions that humans would be able to make even if the programmers wrote the best code that they could. They would not be able to comprehend or perceive in the way that humans do. For example, if the self-driving car were to end up in a situation where a crash was the only outcome. What would the computer pick, would it choose to save the greater number of lives or would it choose to save the passengers. For anyone who was faced with a decision, saving the greatest number of lives is likely the decision they would make, but what happens if you knew the self-driving vehicle would possibly kill you as the passenger to save more lives. You likely would not ride in that self-driving vehicle which is not good for business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, with our current laws and regulations for self-driving vehicles we do not have much in the way of restrictions and regulations which prevents much in the way of liability for the company and programmers that create the vehicles in the case of loss of life of the passenger(s) or pedestrian(s). If there were more in the way of rules and laws for self-driving vehicles it would be able to hold people reliable for deaths or injuries caused to people.

                    Personally, I think that with the current way that the technology is going we will have to see big changes in this sector or else we will not be able to implement new rules and regulations since the technology will be too mainstream for any changes to make a difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall while I feel self-driving vehicles are the way we should be heading, there is a lot of work ahead to make sure they are created in a safe way and in a way that makes sure people are held accountable for whatever outcomes occur.
